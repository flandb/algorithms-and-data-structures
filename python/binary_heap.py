"""
Binary heap data structure implementation to be used for efficient sorting,
priority queue implementation, heapsort, etc.
The main operations supported by binary heaps are:

insert(x): inserts item x into heap in position with proper dominance.
delete(): removes and returns root node of heap, and rebalances.
heapify(): removes right-most leaf node and places it at the root;
'bubble down' new root until heap structure and dominance preserved correctly.
